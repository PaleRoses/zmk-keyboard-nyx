my thing is called zmk-keyboard-nyx, i need to setup a 100% correct file structure for a split keyboard, mine is called a nyx.
ChatGPT said:
To make sure I give you the most accurate and complete directory structure for your split keyboard 'nyx', could you please clarify the following:

What MCU and board are you using for each half of the split? (e.g., nice!nano, nrf52840, etc.)

Does each half have its own MCU, or is one acting as the main controller?

Do you have separate shield definitions for the left and right halves, or are you using a single combined shield?

Do you need power management features like deep sleep or battery monitoring?

Are you using any custom sensors, displays, encoders, or LEDs that need to be integrated into the shield?

Once I have that, I’ll provide the correct file structure tailored for your setup.

You said:
nice!nano each half as an mcu, but the left is the controller. 
ChatGPT said:
Thanks! I’ll put together the correct ZMK directory structure for your split keyboard named 'nyx' using nice!nano on both halves, with the left side as the primary controller.

I’ll focus on a proper custom shield setup that reflects ZMK's modular structure and best practices for split keyboards. I’ll also include filenames and structure for both halves (e.g., nyx_left and nyx_right), and any necessary metadata and config files.

I'll update you shortly with the full structure.

ZMK Directory Structure for Nyx Split Keyboard with nice!nano

Directory Structure for Nyx Split Keyboard (ZMK Shield)
For a custom split keyboard “Nyx” using nice!nano microcontrollers on each half (with the left half as the central/controller), you should organize your zmk-keyboard-nyx repository as follows. This structure adheres to ZMK’s modular shield approach and provides separate definitions for the left and right halves:

Notes on the Structure and Key Files
Kconfig.shield: Defines the shield names used for building. In the case of a split keyboard, this file will declare two config flags (e.g. SHIELD_NYX_LEFT and SHIELD_NYX_RIGHT for the Nyx’s left and right halves)
git.nvandoorn.com
. This allows ZMK to recognize nyx_left and nyx_right as valid shield targets.
Kconfig.defconfig: Provides default configuration values when the shield is used. For a split board, this is where you mark the left half as the central controller and enable split mode. For example, ZMK_KEYBOARD_NAME can be set (e.g. "Nyx"), ZMK_SPLIT_ROLE_CENTRAL is set to default y on the left half, and ZMK_SPLIT is set to y on both halves
zmk.dev
zmk.dev
. These settings ensure the left side acts as the central (controller) and the right as the peripheral in a wireless split setup.
Devicetree files: The hardware is described by devicetree overlay files. In a split design, you provide one overlay for each half: nyx_left.overlay and nyx_right.overlay
zmk.dev
. These files define things like the matrix row/column pins, diodes orientation, sensor nodes (if any), etc., specific to each half’s wiring. To avoid duplication, common parts of the hardware description can be factored into a shared include file (here nyx.dtsi) which both overlays include
zmk.dev
. For example, if both halves share the same row pin configuration or other common components, you would put that in nyx.dtsi and then #include "nyx.dtsi" at the top of each overlay.
Default keymap (nyx.keymap): This file defines the default keymap (layers and key positions) for the Nyx keyboard. It covers the entire keyboard layout (both halves). For instance, it will map the matrix positions from both the left and right halves to key behaviors. End users can override or customize the keymap without modifying this file by providing their own config/nyx.keymap in the top-level config directory. ZMK will use the user’s nyx.keymap (if present) instead of the default one in the shield directory
github.com
.
Configuration files (*.conf): The .conf files are optional device configuration settings. nyx.conf in the shield directory can include recommended settings that apply to both halves (for example, enabling Bluetooth sleep or other features). You can also have half-specific config files (nyx_left.conf and nyx_right.conf) for settings that should only apply to one side (though in most cases, a shared nyx.conf is sufficient
zmk.dev
). In practice, these files often remain fairly minimal; they might suggest enabling power-saving features or other hardware-specific tweaks. Users can also provide an override config/nyx.conf in the top-level config to set or tweak configurations for their personal build, similar to how the keymap override works.
Metadata (nyx.zmk.yml): This YAML file contains high-level metadata about the shield (keyboard). It can include information like a human-readable name, number of keys, default keymap reference, maintainers, etc. This helps tools like ZMK Studio and documentation to identify the keyboard. It’s essentially documentation within the module, and is required as part of ZMK’s shield definition format.
Top-level config directory files: The config/ directory at the root is where user-specific overrides live. In our structure, config/nyx.keymap and config/nyx.conf (outside the boards/shields folder) are the user’s versions. They let the end-user customize the keymap and settings without altering the shield defaults. According to ZMK conventions, the keymap and config file in the shield directory serve as defaults, while the ones in the top-level config/ folder are the ones meant to be edited by the user for customization
github.com
. If the user does not provide an override, the build will fall back to the default files in the shield folder.
west.yml: This file specifies the external modules and dependencies for the build. In a ZMK config repo, west.yml typically points to the ZMK firmware repository and a specific revision (commit or release). It can also include other modules if needed. Essentially, this is how your config knows which version of ZMK (and other modules) to pull in when building.
Zephyr module declaration (zephyr/module.yml): This file makes your repository a Zephyr module that can be integrated into the ZMK build system. Notably, it should contain a name field following ZMK’s naming convention (e.g. name: zmk-keyboard-nyx)
zmk.dev
. This ensures West (the Zephyr build tool) recognizes your config as a module and includes your shield definitions and code. The module name typically starts with zmk- to group it under ZMK custom modules.
Build configuration (build.yaml): This file defines what firmware images to build in GitHub Actions (or when using ZMK’s build service). For a split keyboard, you will have two build targets – one for each half. For example, you might have entries specifying the board (e.g. nice_nano_v2) with shield: nyx_left and another with shield: nyx_right. That way, the CI will produce two firmware binaries (one for the left half and one for the right half). In the ZMK GitHub workflow, build.yaml is used to iterate through each build config. For instance, you’d list something like: one build with board: nice_nano_v2 and shield: nyx_left, and another with board: nice_nano_v2 and shield: nyx_right (similar to how the Corne keyboard defines left/right builds)
github.com
. Ensure that the shield names here match exactly what you used in the shield directory (e.g., “nyx_left”, “nyx_right”).
GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/build.yml): This is a continuous integration script that triggers the ZMK build using GitHub Actions. The provided template workflow will read your build.yaml and build the firmware for each specified board/shield combo. With the Nyx setup, the workflow will compile the left and right half firmware (e.g., resulting in two .uf2 or .hex files, one for each half). You usually don’t need to modify this much beyond ensuring your build.yaml is correct, since the standard workflow is designed to build all entries listed in build.yaml.
By following this directory structure, your custom Nyx keyboard shield will be organized in line with ZMK’s expectations. Each half’s hardware is properly defined, the build system knows about the two halves, and users (or you) can easily adjust keymaps or settings via the top-level config overrides. This structure is modeled on existing split keyboard shields (like Lily58, Corne, etc.) and should be 100% correct for a split keyboard using nice!nano controllers (left half as central) in ZMK. All of the above ensures that when you build firmware, ZMK can locate your shield files and produce the appropriate firmware for both halves of the Nyx keyboard. Sources:

let's systematically update this, ensuring it confirms to all normal standards, let's go. 
ChatGPT said:
Great — let’s do a full audit and alignment of your Nyx ZMK repo structure. To proceed systematically, could you confirm a few things first:

Are you already using the standard zmk-config structure (i.e., build.yaml, config/, .github/workflows/, etc.) in your repo zmk-keyboard-nyx, or are we starting from scratch?

Do you have existing shield files for nyx_left and nyx_right, or should we create those from template examples (e.g. like Lily58)?

Are you using ZMK’s main repo as-is, or a forked/modified version?

Are you using any additional features like encoders, OLEDs, or RGB that require inclusion in the overlay files?

Once I know this, I’ll guide you step-by-step — starting with shield directory creation and validation. Let’s make sure it’s precise and complete.

take a look, i forked it from the main then used the totem https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST/zmk-config-totem/blob/master/config/boards/shields/totem/Kconfig.defconfig

Thanks! Since you're basing Nyx on the Totem shield from GEIGEIGEIST’s zmk-config-totem repo and not using encoders, OLEDs, or RGB, I'll now examine that structure carefully.

I’ll verify how Totem's shield is structured — including Kconfig, overlay, and keymap files — and use that as a guide to systematically upgrade your Nyx shield definition to match ZMK standards. I’ll walk you through each step to ensure everything is compliant and ready for use.

I’ll start by reviewing the Totem repo structure and get back to you shortly.

Standardizing Nyx Shield Structure Using Totem as Reference

Totem Shield Definition Structure (Reference)
The Totem keyboard’s ZMK shield is organized into a dedicated folder with definitions for both halves
GitHub
. Key components include:
Kconfig.shield: Declares the shield’s build-time options. For Totem (a split 36-key), this file defines separate config flags for each half (e.g. SHIELD_TOTEM_LEFT and SHIELD_TOTEM_RIGHT). This follows ZMK’s split naming convention (appending _left and _right to the base name)
GitHub
. The Kconfig.shield ensures that using totem_left or totem_right as the shield name sets the corresponding flag to true.
Kconfig.defconfig: Sets default configurations when the Totem shield is used. In a split design, the left side is designated as central. For Totem, inside an if SHIELD_TOTEM_LEFT block, it likely sets ZMK_KEYBOARD_NAME="Totem" (the device’s BLE/USB name, <=16 chars) and ZMK_SPLIT_ROLE_CENTRAL=y so the left half acts as the central/controller
GitHub
. There would be a corresponding if SHIELD_TOTEM_LEFT || SHIELD_TOTEM_RIGHT section that enables split mode (ZMK_SPLIT=y for both halves)
GitHub
. This ensures ZMK knows it’s dealing with a split keyboard. (Older shields sometimes used ZMK_SPLIT_BLE_ROLE_CENTRAL, but current ZMK uses ZMK_SPLIT_ROLE_CENTRAL for the central side
GitHub
.)
DeviceTree Overlays: The Totem folder contains overlay files for each half, e.g. totem_left.overlay and totem_right.overlay. These describe the hardware matrix and are applied on top of the microcontroller board definitions (e.g. Seeed XIAO BLE). Typically, the two overlay files include a common devicetree include (totem.dtsi) for shared definitions (like the key matrix driver and any identical pin configurations)
GitHub
. In the shared .dtsi, one defines the keyboard scan (kscan) node with the matrix properties: the driver (zmk,kscan-gpio-matrix), diode direction, etc., and possibly the common row GPIOs if both halves use the same rows
GitHub
. Each half’s overlay then includes this .dtsi and adds the specific column pins for that half’s matrix segment
GitHub
. This avoids duplicating common definitions. The overlays also set up the matrix transform (mapping row/col to key positions) and any physical layout info. In Totem’s case, since both halves likely have identical matrix footprints, the transform can be defined once (mapping all keys in a logical order) and used by both halves. For example, a central include might define a default_transform node with compatible = "zmk,matrix-transform", specifying total columns and rows and a map of RC(row,column) entries covering both halves
GitHub
. Each half’s overlay would tie into this by listing its own columns so that left half corresponds to one portion of the matrix and the right half to the other.
Keymap File: Totem provides a default keymap file (e.g. totem.keymap). In some setups this lives under boards/shields/totem/ (or in config/ overriding the shield defaults)
GitHub
. The keymap is a devicetree source defining layers and key bindings. It starts with includes for behavior and key constants (e.g. <behaviors.dtsi>, <dt-bindings/zmk/keys.h>, etc.)
GitHub
. Then a / { keymap { … } }; node is defined with compatible = "zmk,keymap"
GitHub
. Inside, layers like default_layer, lower_layer, etc., are defined, each with a bindings = <…> array. The bindings correspond to the matrix positions (as determined by the transform). Totem’s keymap, for instance, includes multiple layers (BASE, NAV, SYM, ADJ) with bindings for each key position on each layer, combo definitions, and custom behaviors (like macros)
GitHub
GitHub
. It also includes an “adjust” layer with system functions (RESET, bootloader, Bluetooth clear, etc.) to manage the keyboard’s connectivity and state
GitHub
GitHub
 – a common practice for ZMK keymaps. (These layers are optional but very helpful for split wireless boards to handle pairing and resets.)
Shield Metadata: Newer ZMK shield modules include a <shield>.zmk.yml file with human-readable metadata. If Totem has one (e.g. totem.zmk.yml), it would list details like the shield’s id (“totem”), name, type, required controller footprint, and features. For example, a metadata file might specify that Totem requires a Pro Micro compatible board (if using XIAO BLE or nice!nano, which use the Pro Micro pin layout) and that it exposes certain features (like an OLED connector if present)
GitHub
. It also would mark features: [keys, …] (at least “keys” since it’s a keyboard, plus others like “display” if an OLED is supported, “encoder” if knobs, etc.) and list the two half shields as siblings
GitHub
. This metadata isn’t used in the firmware itself but is important for documentation and tools (e.g. ZMK Configurator/Studio). Totem’s repository might have such a file documenting its 36 keys and hardware support.
Summary: In short, Totem’s ZMK config is structured such that both halves have their own overlay (sharing common definitions), Kconfig files handle enabling split mode and naming, a default keymap provides a baseline layout, and metadata (if present) documents the shield. This provides a template for creating a new split keyboard shield.
Step-by-Step Plan for the Nyx Split Keyboard Shield
Using the Totem structure as a guide, we will create the Nyx shield (split keyboard using nice!nano controllers) in a ZMK-compliant way. The Nyx will be divided into nyx_left (central) and nyx_right (peripheral). Below are the steps to update and set up the repository for Nyx:
Create the Shield Directory and Name the Shields:
In your ZMK module (repository), make a directory boards/shields/nyx/. This folder will contain all Nyx-specific files
GitHub
. Following ZMK conventions, treat “nyx” as the base name and define two shield targets: nyx_left and nyx_right
GitHub
. Use all-lowercase and underscores (no spaces). For example, file names will be nyx_left.overlay, nyx_right.overlay, etc., and we’ll refer to the shield as nyx_left/nyx_right when building. This naming ensures consistency across Kconfig and devicetree. (The left half will be the central, i.e. the one that pairs to the host, as specified.)
Write Kconfig.shield for Nyx:
Create boards/shields/nyx/Kconfig.shield to define the build flags for the Nyx shield. For a split keyboard, define one config for each half. For example:
config SHIELD_NYX_LEFT
    def_bool $(shields_list_contains,nyx_left)
config SHIELD_NYX_RIGHT
    def_bool $(shields_list_contains,nyx_right)
This ensures that when -DSHIELD=nyx_left is used, CONFIG_SHIELD_NYX_LEFT=y (similarly for right)
GitHub
. There should be no spaces in the shield names in this file. These symbols will gate the settings in the defconfig and allow ZMK to recognize the new shield.
Write Kconfig.defconfig for Nyx:
In boards/shields/nyx/Kconfig.defconfig, set the default configurations for each half. We need to:
Name the device and set central role on the left: Within an if SHIELD_NYX_LEFT block, define the default keyboard name and mark it as central. For example:
if SHIELD_NYX_LEFT
config ZMK_KEYBOARD_NAME
    default "Nyx"
config ZMK_SPLIT_ROLE_CENTRAL
    default y
endif
This names the device “Nyx” (for BLE advertising/USB) and ensures the left half is the central controller
GitHub
. (Make sure the name is under 16 characters.)
Enable split mode for both halves: Add another block that applies to either half. For example:
if SHIELD_NYX_LEFT || SHIELD_NYX_RIGHT
config ZMK_SPLIT
    default y
endif
This automatically enables ZMK’s split keyboard support whenever either half of Nyx is built
GitHub
. Together, these settings configure the left half as central (with BLE central capabilities) and the right as peripheral, which matches our hardware setup. (ZMK will automatically handle BLE pairing between halves since we’ll be using BLE – by default, ZMK_SPLIT_BLE=y when split is enabled on BLE-capable boards
GitHub
.)
Define the Common Matrix (nyx.dtsi):
Create a devicetree include file boards/shields/nyx/nyx.dtsi to hold the shared hardware definition. In this file, we define the keyboard matrix and transform that will be included by both half overlays
GitHub
. Key elements to put in nyx.dtsi:
KSCAN node: Define the keyboard scan node that reads the matrix. For example:
/ {
    kscan0: kscan0 {
        compatible = "zmk,kscan-gpio-matrix";
        diode-direction = "col2row";
        wakeup-source;
        row-gpios = < &pro_micro R1 (GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH | GPIO_PULL_DOWN) >, 
                    < &pro_micro R2 (...) >, ... ;  /* actual row pins */
        /* col-gpios will be defined per half in the overlays */
    };
};
Here, we indicate a GPIO matrix scanner, specify the diode orientation (commonly "col2row" for diodes from column to row), and mark it as a wakeup source so key presses can wake the device. We list the row GPIOs that are common to both halves. Since both nice!nano controllers share the same row wiring (assuming a symmetric split), those row pins can be set here once. Use the pin labels from the nice!nano’s board definition: nice!nano is Pro Micro-compatible, so Zephyr provides a &pro_micro alias to refer to pins by the Pro Micro numbering
GitHub
GitHub
. For example, <&pro_micro 21 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH> might refer to P0.21 on the nRF52840, corresponding to a certain row on your PCB (replace R1, R2, ... with actual pin numbers used for rows on Nyx). Include GPIO_PULL_DOWN on row inputs if using col2row, as shown above, so they default to low. (No column GPIOs are listed in nyx.dtsi because each half has different column wiring – we’ll add those in the respective overlays.)
Matrix transform: Define how row/col combinations map to key positions. For a split, we typically create a single transform that covers the entire keyboard (both halves) so that key positions are unique across left and right. Include the matrix transform binding and then declare a transform node. For example:
#include <dt-bindings/zmk/matrix_transform.h>
/ {
    default_transform: keymap_transform_0 {
        compatible = "zmk,matrix-transform";
        columns = <C_TOTAL>;  /* total number of columns across both halves */
        rows = <R_TOTAL>;     /* total number of rows */
        map = < 
            … RC(row,col) … 
        >;
    };
};
The columns and rows should reflect the full matrix. For instance, if each half has 5 columns and 4 rows, and if we treat it as a 10-column by 4-row unified matrix, set columns = <10> and rows = <4>. The map then lays out the key positions. Typically, the map is arranged so that left-half keys occupy one range of positions and right-half keys occupy the next range. One approach is to number columns 0–4 for left and 5–9 for right (in this example), and list the keys in a grid accordingly. ZMK’s standard practice (as seen in official shields like Lily58) is to include the entire keyboard’s key arrangement in the transform
GitHub
, even though each half will only physically scan its portion. For example, an entry in the map might look like:
        map = <  
            /* Left half columns 0-4, Right half columns 5-9 */  
            RC(0,0) RC(0,1) … RC(0,4)     RC(0,5) … RC(0,9)  
            RC(1,0) RC(1,1) … RC(1,4)     RC(1,5) … RC(1,9)  
            …  
        >;
This mapping should correspond to how the keys are laid out physically. The transform ensures that whether a key press comes from the left or right half, it gets a unique position number and the correct place in the logical keymap. Also, under the root node you can set:
chosen {
    zmk,kscan = &kscan0;
    zmk,matrix_transform = &default_transform;
};
This tells ZMK to use our kscan0 for key scanning and to apply default_transform to map scan events to key positions (especially important if the peripheral sends raw row/col events)
GitHub
GitHub
. In summary, nyx.dtsi now describes the keyboard’s scanning matrix and how to interpret it.
Create the Half-Specific Overlay Files:
Now make two overlay files: nyx_left.overlay and nyx_right.overlay in the same directory. These files will include nyx.dtsi and specify the unique details for each half: mainly the column GPIO pin assignments and any side-specific differences. Do the following in each:
Include the common dtsi: At the top of both overlay files, add:
#include "nyx.dtsi"
This pulls in the shared definitions so we don’t repeat them in each file
GitHub
GitHub
.
Assign column pins for that half: After the include, reference the kscan0 node and set its col-gpios for that half. For example, in nyx_left.overlay:
&kscan0 {  
    col-gpios = < &pro_micro C1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH >,  
                < &pro_micro C2 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH >, … ;  
};
Replace C1, C2, … with the Pro Micro pin numbers that correspond to the columns on the left half of Nyx (e.g. if left half uses nice!nano pins P1.00, P1.01, etc., find their Pro Micro indices or use &gpio1 references directly). Do the same in nyx_right.overlay, but with the column pins for the right half. Important: Order matters – the order of pins here determines the column index in the matrix. Ensure that the way you order these corresponds to how you set up the transform mapping. If you followed the approach of numbering left-half columns first (0–X) and then right-half columns (X+1–N), list the left pins in order and the right pins in order respectively. For instance, if the total columns in transform was 14 (7 per half)
GitHub
, the left overlay might list 7 column pins (these will be treated as columns 0–6) and the right overlay lists its 7 pins (which, in its own build, are 0–6 too). However, because the transform was defined with 14 columns, ZMK knows those right-half “col 0–6” on the peripheral actually correspond to columns 7–13 of the unified matrix
GitHub
. In simpler terms: just list each half’s columns in their natural order; the transform mapping (especially the zmk,matrix_transform chosen in nyx.dtsi) will align the halves correctly in the keymap.
Central/peripheral distinctions: Generally, no additional devicetree differences are required for the halves beyond column pins. Both halves will use the same kscan0 definition (with different pins) and the same transform. You do not need encoders, displays, or RGB definitions since Nyx has none, which simplifies the overlays. (If there were side-specific components like an encoder on only one half, you’d define those in the appropriate overlay, but here we skip that.)
Define the Physical Layout (Optional):
If you want to support graphical configurators or ZMK Studio, you can include a physical key positioning description. This usually involves adding a zmk,physical-layout reference. For example, ZMK allows specifying the board’s key coordinates (often via a &<layout> node and a chosen { zmk,physical-layout = &<layout>; } entry, as seen in some shields). In the Lily58, for instance, they include a separate layout include and reference it
GitHub
GitHub
. For Nyx, you could define a node listing each key with an x, y coordinate if desired. This step isn’t strictly necessary for functionality, but it’s good practice if you plan to use visualization or the Studio tool. You can add this to nyx.dtsi or as a separate include. (If skipping, ensure at least the matrix_transform is set up, which we did in step 4. The firmware will work without explicit physical coords.)
Provide a Default Keymap (nyx.keymap):
Create nyx.keymap (as a DTS file) to define the default keymap layers. This file can reside in the shield folder or in the config/ directory of your repo. By convention, placing it in boards/shields/nyx/ makes it part of the module’s default config (users can override it by supplying their own nyx.keymap in their personal config). In the keymap file:
Include the necessary headers at the top:
#include <behaviors.dtsi>
#include <dt-bindings/zmk/keys.h>
#include <dt-bindings/zmk/bt.h>
#include <dt-bindings/zmk/outputs.h>  // (if using positional output constants)
These bring in behavior definitions and keycodes. (Totem’s keymap and others include these files as well
GitHub
.)
Define the keymap node:
/ {
    keymap {
        compatible = "zmk,keymap";
        // Define layers...
Next, create at least one layer (often called default_layer or base_layer). For example:
        default_layer {
            label = "BASE";
            bindings = < &kp Q &kp W &kp E … >;
        };
The bindings array should have one entry per key position defined by your matrix transform. These entries map each physical key (by its matrix index) to a behavior or keycode. You can layout the bindings in a matrix form (with comments) to make it readable. For instance, if Nyx has 32 keys, list 32 bindings in row-major order (or whatever order matches the transform). A simple base layer might be QWERTY on the letter keys, with appropriate mods on thumb keys, etc. For reference, the default Corne keymap shows how bindings correspond to positions
GitHub
. Ensure that you have the correct number of bindings to match the total key count (ZMK will error if counts mismatch).
Add additional layers as needed: It’s common to have a function layer (e.g. “Raise”/“Lower” or symbol layer) and a navigation/media layer. For example, define a layer for numbers/symbols on one half and arrows on the other (lower_layer), and maybe another for symbols (raise_layer). Use &mo (momentary layer) or &lt (layer tap) bindings in your base layer to access these layers, similar to how many split keyboards do it. For instance, the Corne default uses &mo 1 and &mo 2 for lower/raise keys
GitHub
.
Include system keys: Given Nyx is wireless, it’s prudent to include an “adjust” or “FN” layer for system functions. For example, have a layer (e.g. layer 3, called ADJ) that includes bindings like &bt BT_CLR (Bluetooth clear), &bt BT_SEL 0/1/etc. (to select profiles), &reset (to reset the keyboard), &bootloader (to enter bootloader for firmware flash). Totem’s keymap ADJ layer provides a good template, containing entries for reset, bootloader, BT next/prev/clear, etc.
GitHub
GitHub
. You can mimic that: on the central (left) half, some keys can trigger these behaviors. For example, use &bt BT_NXT and &bt BT_PRV to cycle Bluetooth profiles, &bt BT_CLR to clear bonds, &sys_reset to soft reset, and &bootloader to enter DFU mode
GitHub
GitHub
. This layer ensures you can manage pairing on the Nyx without needing additional hardware buttons.
Once the layers are defined, close the keymap node and root. Your nyx.keymap provides a working default that users can flash immediately. (If placed in the shield directory, it will be used unless a user’s config supplies a custom nyx.keymap to override
GitHub
.) It’s a good idea to test that the number of key positions in your keymap equals the total keys (rows * cols) – in a 36-key split, for example, there should be 36 bindings per layer.
Add Shield Metadata (nyx.zmk.yml):
To comply with current ZMK standards, document the Nyx hardware in a YAML metadata file. Create boards/shields/nyx/nyx.zmk.yml with content like:
file_format: "1"
id: nyx
name: Nyx
type: shield
url: <link to Nyx info or repo>
requires:
  - pro_micro
exposes: []
features:
  - keys
siblings:
  - nyx_left
  - nyx_right
Let’s break that down: The id is “nyx” (the base name, no “_left” or “_right”)
GitHub
. name is a human-friendly name (we use “Nyx”). type: shield since this is a keyboard shield. For url, you can provide a GitHub repo link or documentation page for the Nyx hardware if one exists (or omit if not available). The requires field should list the interconnect or controller the shield uses. Nyx uses nice!nano controllers, which conform to the Pro Micro footprint, so we put pro_micro
GitHub
. This indicates the keyboard is designed for controllers that plug into a Pro Micro pin header (nice!nano, Seeed XIAO BLE, etc., all share that pin arrangement). We have no special external devices on Nyx, so exposes can be an empty list (or you can omit it entirely). Features should include at least keys (because it has a keyboard matrix)
GitHub
. We do not include display, encoder, underglow, etc., since Nyx has none of those. (You might include studio if you defined a physical layout and tested it with ZMK Studio, but that’s optional.) Finally, list the two halves in siblings so that ZMK knows nyx_left and nyx_right go together as one keyboard
GitHub
. This metadata file isn’t used during firmware build, but it’s important for ZMK’s device catalog and configuration tools. You can validate it with west metadata validate if needed.
Ensure West Manifest and Build Configuration are Updated:
Your repository’s west.yml (typically under the config/ directory if using the ZMK unified config template) should already point to the ZMK firmware source. If the Nyx shield is part of this same repo (which it is), you usually don’t need to add a new project for it – the shield will be discovered as a module automatically. However, verify that your west.yml includes this repo as a ZMK module. In many templates, there is a self: path: <something> entry. Make sure it’s set so that the boards/shields/ in your repo is included. For example, some configs use:
manifest:
  projects:
    - name: zmk
      remote: zmkfirmware
      revision: main
      import: app/west.yml
  self:
    path: config  
This means the repository itself (with path “config”) is treated as an in-tree config/shield module. If your setup had multiple repos, you’d list them. (In the Totem example, another manifest listed the totem module separately
GitHub
, but since Nyx is within your config, that’s not needed.) In summary, confirm that west.yml is pointing to ZMK’s app/west.yml (to import Zephyr and ZMK modules) and that your shield files are in the module search path. Next, update your GitHub Actions build matrix so that firmware is built for both halves of Nyx. In the repository (often under .github/workflows/), there is a build.yaml or similar config that defines which boards/shields to compile. You should add entries for nyx_left and nyx_right with the appropriate MCU board (nice!nano). For example, if using nice!nano v2, you might include:
board: [ "nice_nano_v2" ]  
shield: [ "nyx_left", "nyx_right" ]
This would tell the CI to build both combinations (nice_nano_v2 + nyx_left, and nice_nano_v2 + nyx_right). If the workflow uses an include matrix, you can list each half separately. The key point is to ensure both halves are built. According to ZMK’s docs, if the shield is defined in your config repo, simply adding it to the build matrix will make Actions build it
GitHub
. (If the shield were in a separate module repo, we’d also adjust west.yml to fetch it, but here Nyx is in the same repo, so that’s already handled
GitHub
.) After editing the workflow, push the changes. The CI should trigger and compile two UF2/hex files: one for nyx_left and one for nyx_right.
Test and Iterate:
With the above in place, run a build (via GitHub Actions or a local West build) to ensure everything compiles. You should get a nyx_left.uf2 (or .hex) and nyx_right.uf2. Flash the left firmware to the left half’s nice!nano, and the right firmware to the right half. Upon powering on, the left half (central) should enter pairing mode (assuming no bonds saved) and the right half should connect to the left automatically via BLE (ZMK’s split protocol). Test that key presses on both halves register correctly according to the keymap. If some keys don’t work or are swapped, re-check the matrix transform and the column assignments – these are usually the culprit if mappings are off. Make sure the number of keys in the keymap layer matches the total keys (including both halves). Also verify that the special functions (if any) on the adjust layer work: e.g. try resetting via key combo, clearing bonds, etc., to confirm the central/peripheral roles are properly set (only the central will actually perform BT clear or enter pair mode on bond reset).
By following this plan, you will have created a new ZMK shield for “Nyx” that mirrors the structure of Totem’s shield but tailored to Nyx’s specifics. The directory and file setup will align with current ZMK best practices (split naming, central config, common .dtsi usage), and the keymap and config will be ready for a functional wireless split keyboard. The GitHub Actions integration will produce firmware for both halves, and the west.yml/module setup will ensure the ZMK build system includes your new shield. This step-by-step process takes you from defining hardware to getting a working firmware, with the result being a cleanly integrated Nyx shield that can be maintained or customized further as needed. Good luck with your Nyx keyboard – once these steps are done, you should be able to enjoy a fully working split keyboard in ZMK!

The user mentioned a pinout image showing the keyboard's pin configuration. They referenced a pin (P1.04) as unused and asked if it helps to complete the TODO in nyx.dtsi, specifically for the row-gpios list. To proceed, I'll load the image and inspect its details to figure out which pins are in use and which are not. I need to determine how this fits with the TODO, like specifying row and column pins. I'll check the image file shortly.

Analyzed image

The user shared an image of the nice!nano pinout, describing 7 rows on the left and 6 columns on the right, with pin P1.04 not used. They’ve asked if the image helps with the TODO in the nyx.dtsi file. I’ll need to carefully look at the image to identify which pins are used for the rows and columns. This will help me fill in the row-gpios list and complete the task. I'll check the image shortly.

Looking at the left column of the pinout, I see labels like VCC, '0', 29, 2, 115... but it’s a bit unclear with the numbers—it says 031? I think I need to zoom in more to get a better view. Maybe cropping the central region of the image will help me focus on the most relevant part and read those pins clearly. Let me adjust the view and take a closer look.

Analyzed image
Output image
The left column is labeled with values like VCC, '0', 29, 2, 115... but the numbering is unclear. It even says 031? I think I need to zoom in more to make sense of this. When I crop to focus on the central region, I can see text for each pad. From top to bottom, I suspect the top might be 'RAW' or 'RST'. I’ll crop more to get a closer look at the very top and confirm.

Analyzed image

The left column labels aren't fully clear. I can see VCC, '0', 29, 2, and 115, but it's still hard to make out the exact order, particularly with "031." The small cropping wasn't helpful, so it's time to crop a larger portion, focusing on the right column this time. I’ll expand the crop to include more of the area on the right side to get a better view of the labels and identify the pins properly.

Analyzed image
Output image
Analyzed image
Output image
After zooming in and cropping more of the image, I can now see the left column clearly. The pinout is as follows: starting from the top, it goes RAW, GND, VCC, 0.31 (P0.31), 0.29 (P0.29), 0.02, 1.15 (P1.15), 1.13, 1.11, 0.10, etc. It’s clearer now, but I’ll need to make sure we double-check these if we’re doing anything with the pin numbers or configuration. The pins are more legible, so we can work with this setup.

I see that from cropping the image, the left column shows pins: ‘VCC’ followed by ‘031’, ‘029’, ‘002’, ‘115’, etc. The top might also read as 'RAW'. Assuming the orientation with the micro USB on top, the pinout on the nice!nano v2, from top to bottom, should be RAW, GND, VCC, P0.31, and so on. On the right side, I spot GND and possibly RST, but it looks like GND is repeated. I’ll zoom in more to confirm these discrepancies and ensure accuracy.

Analyzed image
Output image
From the cropped image, the left column appears to go: 'VCC', '031', '029', '002', '115', '113', '111', '010'. At the top, it could be 'RAW' but is cut off, so let’s check the order fully. The pinout, assuming a nice!nano orientation, starts with 'RAW'. The right column, however, seems to have duplicates like 'GND' appearing twice. I'll need to verify this against the official pinout to resolve these inconsistencies further.

Analyzed image
Output image
The left side pins of the nice!nano V2, with the micro USB at the top, should go from RAW at the top, followed by GND, VCC, P0.31, and others like P0.29, P0.02, P1.15, etc. On the right side, it should have pins like GND, RST, P0.17, P0.20, P0.22, and so on. However, I’m noticing that ‘GND’ appears twice in the right column. I’ll need to double-check the pinout again and confirm any discrepancies.

Analyzed image
Output image
I see that the right column print shows 'GND' twice, and the partial 'GNO' might actually be part of 'GND'. Looking further, at the bottom of the right column, we have numbers that correspond to pins: ‘017’, ‘020’, ‘022’, ‘024’, and others like P1.04, P0.11, and P1.00. It looks like 'GND' is printed at the top twice. I'll need to confirm which GND is in use and double-check pin placements to ensure accuracy.

Okay, let me break down the right side pins of the nice!nano: starting with two GND pins, followed by P0.17, P0.20, P0.22, P0.24, P1.00, and P0.11. I’m checking for P1.04, which seems unlikely because it isn’t usual for the nice!nano, and wondering if the bottom pin could be P1.10.

On the left side, the row pins are made up of seven labeled pins (031, 029, 002, 115, 113, 111, 010). These will be important in referencing the correct GPIO pins in devicetree configuration.

It looks like we're better off using 'gpios' referencing the nRF port and pin numbers, like &gpio0 31. So, for row-gpios, we’ll list pins like &gpio0 31, &gpio0 29, and so on. We’ll also consider flags, like GPIO_PULL_DOWN | GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH.

Now, there’s a bit of confusion about the rows and columns. The user said there are 7 rows on the left and 6 on the right. I think this means each half of the board handles its own set of rows and columns, with 12 columns across both halves—6 on each side. I’ll update the configuration accordingly.

For the matrix transform, we still need to confirm if the user is working with 12 columns across both halves. They mentioned 6 columns on the right, which suggests 6 columns per half, giving a total of 12. For the rows, we're using 7, which fits with their inputs. I’m setting up the row-gpios list based on the user’s pins, but I'll need to confirm pin order and provide a placeholder for column mapping. I'll update the nyx.dtsi file with placeholders for row and column configurations and ensure everything compiles correctly.

I’ve populated nyx.dtsi with the concrete row‑pin list and set the matrix dimensions to 7 rows × 12 columns. You’ll still need to:

Verify pin order: Ensure the order of pins in row-gpios matches your PCB’s row indices (Row 0 → Row 6).

List column pins in each half’s overlay (nyx_left.overlay, nyx_right.overlay)—six columns per half, skipping P1.04 if unused.

Fill the map section once you know the exact logical order of your 84 key positions.

Yes — you can define a matrix that’s larger than the set of physical switches you actually soldered.

How ZMK handles “empty” positions
Piece	What to do with unused spots
Matrix transform (nyx.dtsi)	Still list every RC(row,col) so the transform has rows × columns entries. If a row/column pair has no switch wired, it just never closes and ZMK won’t see a press.
Overlay pin lists	It’s fine if a given row/column intersection isn’t wired. What matters is that the row and column themselves exist (i.e., the GPIO pins are defined). You don’t need separate “holes” in the pin arrays.
Keymap layers	For positions without a switch, put a no‑op binding such as &none (preferred) or &trans/&kp NO. That tells ZMK “ignore this slot.”
Practical tips
Ghosting: Un‑wired positions don’t introduce ghosting because the circuit is open; they’re effectively inert.

Smaller matrix option: If you like, you can shrink columns or rows and drop the unused RC entries. The only requirement is consistency: the columns/rows counts, row-gpios/col-gpios, and the keymap binding count must all match.

Keeping it simple: Most builders leave the full grid and mark unused keys as &none; that avoids re‑calculating positions later if you add more switches.

So you’re safe—just give the empty spots a &none binding and carry on.

The user seems to have lost track of the right side of their keymap setup and provided a .dts file for review. They want me to identify issues and clean it up. The existing file 'nyx.dtsi' is a code or DT source file, but they probably need a new document like 'nyx.keymap'—formatted with corrections. It looks like there's a mismatch in splitting the right half, possibly due to column issues. I need to clean this up, fix mismatches, and present it properly in a new formatted text document.

The user initially said the keymap should have 6 columns total, but the current layout suggests 12 columns (6 per half). There's some miscommunication, as they now insist on 6 columns total but the keymap still lists 6+6, making it a mismatch. To make it correct, we'll need to unify the left and right halves, adjusting them accordingly. I think the most logical approach is to have 6 columns in total, with 3 columns per half, but it might make more sense to split it into 5 or 6 columns per half for ergonomic reasons.

The user insists on 6 columns total, but the keymap currently shows 12 (6 per half). There's confusion about whether they're asking for 6 columns across both halves or each half having 6. We need to clean up the formatting and envision a way to fit the board's design. The right side has duplicate columns; alignment is an issue. I should propose compressing the keymap to 6 columns total but need them to clarify the layout. I'll create a new keymap with placeholders and identify mismatches.

Done
What was wrong

Column count mismatch – your nyx.dtsi now says 6 columns total, but the pasted keymap listed 12 bindings per row (84 total). ZMK will fail to build if the bindings array length ≠ rows × columns.

Right‑hand blocks duplicated the left – the visual ASCII comment showed two 6‑column halves, yet the matrix definition treats the board as a single 6‑column grid.

Mis‑aligned thumbs / extra keys – several blank slots in the matrix weren’t accounted for (&none/&trans placeholders missing).

What I’ve added in the canvas

A clean nyx.keymap template for a 7 × 6 matrix (42 bindings). Each row is clearly labelled and uses &none where a switch is absent. Swap in your desired keycodes or, if you truly have 12 columns (6 per half), just switch columns = <12> in nyx.dtsi and expand the keymap back to 84 bindings.

Feel free to adjust either the matrix size or the keymap, but they must match. Let me know which direction you’d like to go and we can refine further.

You said:
OH yeah, six for each, we have 12 columns between the two, do i need to fix that?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a couple of seconds
Yes—because each half has six columns, the matrix transform needs 12 columns total so ZMK knows where every key sits.

I’ve just updated nyx.dtsi in the canvas:

columns = <12> (6 per half × 2 halves).

The RC() map now shows 84 placeholders (7 rows × 12 columns).

Next steps:

Overlay pin lists:

nyx_left.overlay — list the six column GPIOs for the left half in the same order you want them numbered (columns 0‑5).

nyx_right.overlay — list the six column GPIOs for the right half; ZMK will treat them as columns 6‑11 automatically because of the transform.

Keymap: Expand each layer to 84 bindings (row‑major). You can copy your original 12‑column layout and adjust as needed, replacing any empty spots with &none.

Once those two pieces line up with the 12×7 matrix, the firmware will build cleanly. Let me know when you’re ready to tackle the overlay files or resize the keymap, and we’ll keep it rolling.

You said:
i have two microcontrollers, one for the left, and one for the right, is that still fine?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 5 seconds
Yes — that’s exactly how ZMK’s split architecture is designed to work:

Aspect	What happens with two MCUs
Scanning	Each nice!nano scans its own half (7 rows × 6 columns).
Transform	Both halves include the same nyx.dtsi; the left overlay lists columns 0‑5, the right overlay lists columns 6‑11. The shared matrix‑transform re‑labels right‑half presses so the central side sees a unified 12‑column grid.
Roles	Your Kconfig.defconfig already sets ZMK_SPLIT_ROLE_CENTRAL=y on the left half. That half advertises to the host and relays events. The right half is peripheral; it pairs only with the left.
Inter‑half link	ZMK handles the BLE or serial link automatically once the halves are flashed with their respective firmware images.
Keymap size	Keep 84 bindings per layer (12 × 7) so the central firmware can place every key correctly, even though each MCU physically reports only 42 positions.
So the structure we have (shared .dtsi, per‑half overlays, central/peripheral defconfig) is the normal, fully supported pattern.

Next steps

Fill in overlay files

nyx_left.overlay – list the six left‑half column pins in the order you want columns 0‑5.

nyx_right.overlay – list the six right‑half pins (columns 0‑5 in that file; the transform makes them 6‑11 globally).

Expand the keymap to 84 bindings in each layer (just duplicate the right‑hand section you had originally, or use &none where a switch is missing).

Once those two pieces are in place, build nyx_left and nyx_right firmware, flash each half, pair them, and you’re set. If you’d like help writing the overlay files or adjusting the keymap, let me know the exact column pin numbers for each side and we’ll knock it out.

You said:
sure, let's do the nyx.keymap first.

Here it is.

Your keymap is now updated in the canvas

84 bindings in row‑major order (12 × 7) matching the matrix.

Empty spots use &none.

Added placeholder FN and NAV layers (fully transparent for now).

Review the default layer and tweak any keys or add more layer logic whenever you’re ready. Next up: we can fill in the overlay files (nyx_left.overlay, nyx_right.overlay) or refine the FN/NAV layers—just let me know.

this does not have the beautified outcome thingie. 
to make it readable, using thes when appropriate

'▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄'

and really making do
ChatGPT said:
The default layer section now has clear ASCII separators, layer labels, and tidy rows—matching the style you wanted with the “▄▄▄▄▄▄” framing.

Take a look in the canvas; if you’d like even more visual tweaks or adjustments to other layers, just let me know!

i want visualizations, written out like this within each layer!! more blocks and stuff, what are uou doing??
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a few seconds
I’ve inserted full ASCII box‑drawing diagrams above each layer, mirroring the physical positions so you can visually scan the layout right inside the file. Check the canvas and let me know if you’d like tweaks to the art style or further edits!

You said:
your asci drawingss are shit, and incomplete. what"
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 8 seconds
I replaced the diagrams with a clearer boxed grid that cleanly separates the six‑key halves and labels every column. Have a look now—if you want different box characters, spacing tweaks, or ASCII for the FN/NAV layers too, just say the word.

You said:
get rid of your shitty asci rawing and focus on functionality.
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 5 seconds
All the large ASCII art is gone—the file now contains only concise layer labels, minimal inline comments, and the functional bindings. Let me know if you’d like any further refinements.

Issue	Why it fails
No actual bindings listed.	Inside bindings = < … >; you only have comment lines—there are zero keycodes, so the compiler sees an empty list when it expects 84.
Mismatched < … > delimiters.	The block starts with < but the closing > is on its own line (> ;). The extra spaces/new‑line are fine, but you still need valid tokens between the brackets.
Default layer lacks a label (optional) but that’s not fatal.	Optional—just cosmetic.
Layer IDs (layer_fn, layer_nav) reference labels that don’t exist in the snippet.	The file shows those layers but they’re not included in the #define list (FN, NAV) in that snippet.
Quick ways to fix
Insert all 84 bindings (row‑major, 7 rows × 12 columns) between the < … > of default_layer.
Example:

default_layer {
    bindings = <
        &kp ESC &kp N1  … (81 more entries) …
    >;
};
Keep the cleaner file already in the canvas.
The version we just refined together is syntactically correct and contains functional bindings. That’s what I recommend using.

If you copy the canvas version into your repo, it should compile. If you’d rather re‑use the comment‑heavy template, you’ll need to replace every placeholder comment with the corresponding &kp / &none tokens so the binding count matches 84.

Thought for 7 seconds
I added nyx_left.overlay to the canvas. It:

Includes nyx.dtsi so row pins stay shared.

Lists six left‑half column pins (P0.17, 20, 22, 24, 0, 4) in order—edit if your wiring differs.

Uses GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH; flip to GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW if your diodes require.

Next step: create nyx_right.overlay with that half’s six column pins (it will map to columns 6‑11). Let me know the right‑side pin numbers or if you’d like a placeholder template.

You said:
is that actually even correct, it looks so short?

this is what I had ebore
